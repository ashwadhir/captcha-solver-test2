# captcha-solver-test2

## Summary
This web application was auto-generated by an LLM based on the following brief:
> Create a captcha solver that loads the attached sample.png. The page must use a JavaScript OCR library like Tesseract.js to read the text from the image and display the solved text inside an element with the id #solved-text within 15 seconds.
This version has been modified to also display the OCR confidence score as a percentage inside an element with the id #confidence-score.
